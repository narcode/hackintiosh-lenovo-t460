EFI and goodies for hackintosh Lenovo T460 with Clover 


## my specs:
Lenovo T460 running Mojave 10.14.6
Processor 2.5 IntelCore i5 (KabyLake)
24 GB RAM (this laptop can go up to 32)
Samsung SSD 
Intel HD Graphics 520
Changed wifi card to...

## what works:
almost everyhting, don't have any issues really. Sometimes after OS updates I need to rollback IOPCIFamily kext for the wifi to work again.


I also have an elitebook HP 830 G5 with OpenCore to test both bootloaders. However I am really happy with how this one is working so decided to keep the Lenovo the way it is.
